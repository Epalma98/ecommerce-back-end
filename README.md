## Description
This backend application uses Object-Relational Mapping to seed information into files which can then be received by users of an ecommerce website.

## Installation
To install, clone the repo from Github. First scource the schema by loading into mySQL and running "source db/schema.sql" then quit. To seed the files, run "node seeds/index.js" in the terminal.
After all that is done run "npm i && npm start" to install the necessary files and start the server.
